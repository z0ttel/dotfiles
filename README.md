# Dotfiles
My Personal dotfiles for oh-my-zsh and nano.

## Zshrc
My zsh configuration uses [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh "oh-my-zsh Github repository") and my custom Oxygen theme, [trapd00rs LS_COLORS](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS "LS_COLORS Github repository"), [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions "zsh-autosuggestions Github repository"), [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting "zsh-syntax-highlighting Github repository")

**Note:** zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions must be installed manually. You may also have to install [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) or disable the alias for cat in ```.aliases.zsh``` line 19.

### Oxygen theme
My Oxygen theme is a fork of [dikiaaps Oxide theme](https://github.com/dikiaap/dotfiles/blob/master/.oh-my-zsh/themes/oxide.zsh-theme "See here"). With a added left Prompt wich displays time and date.

## Nanorc
My Nanorc dosen't depend on anything but [Improved Nano Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc) is recommended.
